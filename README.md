Vaccination Data Analysis and Visualization
📌 Overview

This project analyzes global vaccination data to uncover insights into coverage, disease incidence, and vaccine effectiveness. Data is cleaned and stored in a SQL database, and interactive dashboards are built with Power BI for public health decision-making.

📂 Dataset

Coverage Data: Vaccination rates, doses, target population

Incidence Rate: Disease cases per population unit

Reported Cases: Annual disease cases by country

Vaccine Introduction: Timeline of vaccine adoption

Vaccine Schedule: Doses, target groups, administration details

🛠️ Tech Stack
